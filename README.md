StripeTester is a testing gem used to simulate Stripe webhooks and post them to a specified URL.

StripeTester allows you to submit webhooks to your application without hitting Stripe or requiring connectivity. You can use it in your test suite to simulate webhooks and ensure that your application reacts accordingly. You can also use StripeTester in the console to simulate webhooks easily.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'stripe_tester', "~> 0.4.0"
```
And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```
Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install stripe_tester
```

## Requirements

Ruby `>= 1.9.3`

RSpec

## Usage

In your test:

1. Set the URL where the webhooks are handled:
```ruby
    # Normal HTTP URL
    StripeTester.webhook_url = "http://www.example.com/my_post_url"

    # HTTPS URL
    StripeTester.webhook_url = "https://www.secure-example.com/my_post_url"
```

2. If your URL is secured with a self-signed SSL certificate, disable SSL verification:
```ruby
    StripeTester.verify_ssl = false
```

3. If you want to specify which Stripe webhook API version you would like to use (the default will be the latest [supported version](https://github.com/buttercloud/stripe_tester#supported-stripe-webhook-api-versions)):
```ruby
    StripeTester.stripe_version = "2015-10-16"
```

4. If you are using username and password in your stripe webhook event, you can provide it in two ways.
```ruby
    StripeTester.webhook_password = "<password>"
    or
    you can set it in your webhook_url itself like this
    # Normal HTTP URL
    StripeTester.webhook_url = "http://stripe:password@www.example.com/my_post_url"

    # HTTPS URL
    StripeTester.webhook_url = "https://stripe:password@www.secure-example.com/my_post_url"
```

5. Send the webhook. This will send a POST request to the URL with the event data as JSON:
```ruby
    # as a symbol
    StripeTester.create_event(:invoice_created)

    # or as a string
    StripeTester.create_event("invoice_created")
```

  Or if you want to overwrite certain attributes globally:
```ruby
StripeTester.create_event(:invoice_created, {"amount" => 100, "currency" => 'gbp'})
```

  Or you can explicitly overwrite certain attributes using deep object merging:
```ruby
StripeTester.create_event(:customer_subscription_created, {"data"=>{"object"=>{"plan"=>{"id"=>"gold-v1"}}}}, :method=>:merge)
```

  If you want to load the JSON only:
```ruby
json = StripeTester.load_template(:invoice_payment_failed)
```

  You can also overwrite certain attributes in the JSON:
```ruby
json = StripeTester.load_template(:invoice_payment_failed, {"data"=>{"object"=>{"customer"=>"cus_MYCUSTOMERID"}}}, :method=>:merge)
```
